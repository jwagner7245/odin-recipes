  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>16 oz. dry Fettucine Pasta</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>For the Chicken</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1lb boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
    <li>1tsp Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>3/4tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/4tsp pepper</li>
    <li>2tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1tbsp butter</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>For the Sauce</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2c butter, cut into large cubes or sliced</li>
    <li>2c heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>3/4tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>3/4tsp Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1/4tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/4tsp pepper</li>
    <li>2c freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Make the noodles</strong>: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente according to package directions, usually 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain well. Set aside.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the chicken</strong>: Season chicken breasts with the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Once itâ€™s shimmering, swirl the pan to evenly distribute. Add the chicken and leave it undisturbed for 5-7 minutes, until the bottom is golden-brown. Flip over and add in 1 tablespoon of butter between them, picking up the pan to give it a gentle swirl to distribute. Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes (or an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.)</li>
    <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Tent with foil while you prepare the sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the Alfredo sauce</strong>: In the same pan, over medium-low heat, add the butter and cream; whisk until butter has melted.</li>
    <li>Add in the minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; whisk until combined and smooth.</li>
    <li>Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil) and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken.</li>
    <li>Stir in the parmesan cheese just until melted and the sauce is smooth. (If the sauce ends up too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.)</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble</strong>: Take sauce off the heat and immediately toss with the cooked fettuccine noodles.</li>
    <li>Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
